## Configuring a Redirection Rule

When creating a new rule:

1. **Incoming URL**: The path or URI that users request.
2. **Domain**: The domain under which this redirect should apply (optional, if not using a multi-domain setup).
3. **Target URL**: The destination where traffic should be sent.
4. **Status Code**: Select from 301, 302, 307, or 308 to control the nature of the redirect.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always choose the status code that reflects whether the redirect is temporary or permanent to maintain proper SEO value.

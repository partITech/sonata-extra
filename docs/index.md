# Introduction

The **Partitech Sonata Extra Bundle** is an extension for Symfony projects using Sonata. It provides advanced tools to improve and streamline your back-office management (security, multilingual support, AI integrations, WordPress import, publication approvals, and more).

> [!TIP]
> The following overview is just a summary. For complete details, please refer to the official documentation and the project's GitHub repository.

---

## Security and Activity Tracking

Strengthen your applicationâ€™s security with a comprehensive Activity Log and Content Security Policy. The **Workflow Approval** feature helps you validate critical actions before they go live.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Implementing a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** significantly reduces the risk of XSS and data injection attacks.

---

## Multilingual and Multisite

Seamlessly handle multiple languages and multiple sites simultaneously. You can configure multilingual URLs, set up content blocks, and manage multilingual publishing without adding unnecessary complexity.

> [!NOTE]
> Specific integrations are available for SonataPageBundle and user Admin setups to further simplify multi-language management.

---

## AI Integrations (Smart Services)

Automate key processes **like translations and content generation** through built-in **AI-powered services**. These features can help you speed up repetitive tasks and optimize your workflow.

---

## WordPress Import

Easily import existing WordPress content and manage it directly within Sonata, benefiting from all the advanced features of this bundle.

---

## AsAdmin() Attribute

Simplify your Admin class configurations by using the `AsAdmin()` attribute. This approach offers a concise, readable way to declare Sonata settings.

> [!NOTE]
> The *AsAdmin()* attribute can significantly reduce the boilerplate code needed to configure an entity in Sonata.

---

## Advanced Asset Management

Centralize and optimize the inclusion of your CSS and JavaScript resources, whether external or inline, to keep your codebase organized and efficient.

---

## Blog and Enhanced Layout

Quickly set up a blog with multilingual URLs and reusable blocks (Slider, FAQ, Cookie Consent, etc.). An integrated Gutenberg editor is also available to enrich content creation and presentation.

---

## Content Validation and Publishing

Require approval before publishing to ensure better quality and consistency. The **Approval Workflow** adds a control layer to critical changes and actions in the admin panel.

---

## Sitemap and Redirects

Automate the generation of a `sitemap.xml` file and conveniently manage all your HTTP redirects from the admin interface.

> [!CAUTION]
> Combine these features to build a robust back-office suitable for projects of any size, encompassing a wide range of needs (GDPR, multilingual, SEO, etc.).
